# IIT-BHU-Intern-2021-22

1. You can just fill this [form.](https://forms.gle/dt6Kgzw1PDDURo1G9)

Please add any questions from coding round/interview round that you were present for this year. We are trying to make a collection so it's easier for people this year who haven't got an intern yet AND for people sitting for the intern season next year. For them, a lack of communication skills + TPC portal opening too late for most things might make things difficult for them. 

Thank you for helping!
